A tiny but useful Chrome Extension that will show the manga section that gets hidden via javascript on www.mangacap.com when ABP is enabled.

Uses jQuery only because I like it and I wrote this in about 10 mins ;-)

=============
To install
=============
1. Download from GitHub as a zip file. Unzip it anywhere of your choice (I personally use ~/Documents/Developer/ChromeExt)

2. Open up Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.

3. Click the "Load unpacked extension.." button at the top

4. Browse to the folder you just unzipped and click the "Select" button.

5. Make sure the extension is active and visit www.mangacap.com.

6. Use ABP to block all ads on the domain and this extension will ensure the manga section will stay shown even though they try to hide it with javascript when ads are blocked.

Happy reading!!
